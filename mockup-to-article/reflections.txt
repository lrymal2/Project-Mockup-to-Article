Your response goes here!

I've learned how to use <sup> tags.

Everything has been easy to this point, but I'm sure it will get more challenging.

I've yet to encounter anything difficult, but only because I've been working as a web developer for the past year.

I haven't had to use problem solving strategies yet, but I do believe in the growth mindset, and that I'll need to put them to use once I start getting into new topics.
